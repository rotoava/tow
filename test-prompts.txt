en2zh:A slow-moving Pacific storm prompted evacuations Thursday in cities and beach towns along California's southern coast as streets were submerged beneath floodwaters.

The cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme — both in Ventura County, west of Los Angeles — issued evacuation orders for some coastal areas and at least one shelter was opened for residents fleeing their homes. The Oxnard Fire Department has executed water rescues and, along with the police department, has asked residents to stay off the roads due to widespread flooding. There have not been reports of any injuries or deaths. A brief tornado warning was issued for Ventura County overnight.

The brunt of the storm damage appeared to be in the beachside city of Port Hueneme, according to the Ventura County Star, part of the USA TODAY Network. Roughly 60 homes in a senior community there were evacuated overnight.
